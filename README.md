Paradrew Font
======

**Paradrew Font** is a font family based on the fonts viewed in the Commodore 64 computer game [Paradroid](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradroid)
written by [Andrew Braybrook](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Braybrook).
Paradroid was published in 1985 and was considered by many, one of the trailblazer of its genre and time.
The name of this font is a merge of "_Paradroid_" and the first name of its creator "_Andrew_ Braybrook".

The font is vectorized based upon screenshots of the original bitmaps and best efforts
were given to honor the original font - some divergence were done to adhere typographical guidelines.
